# ChromiumTexture
The official resource pack used on Chromium, an all-op server based on
the sandbox game "Minecraft". Our resource pack utilizes high-quality
texturing with bigger files to give the game a better look. Our project
is open-source, therefore you can tweak this and use it for your own mod.

#### How do I download it?
Official downloads of ChromiumTexture can be obtained in this Git's
releases. Each download is marked with the final version number.
Each version number is a one-digit numeral that goes after the resource
pack name. Each file in the versions have a different meaning. The ZIP
file with "ChromiumTexture 1.(your minecraft version)" should be used
for your client. Usually, multiple ZIP files are offered which provides
legacy support for older clients. A JAR file is listed below, which is
only useful to resource pack editors and makers. All it does is convert
pre-1.6 texture packs to 1.6+ resource pack fomat. It does not affect
the gameplay at all, you shouldn't download it if you aren't a resource packer.

#### How can I modify it?
Our resource pack is under a Creative Commons license that allows share-alike
content copied off this project to be made by both personal and commercial use.
In a way, ChromiumTexture doubles as an API for those that want to make things
based off it. You must include credit to the resource pack creator (ShadowArmadyl)
somewhere in the modified folder if you wish to distrute your modified ChromiumTexture, however.

#### When will you provide support for 1.9?
Minecraft 1.9 is currently in beta, therefore we will not release official downloads
for it's textures until it is released as final. Although I'm working on my private
snapshots for it, I'm not giving them out because pre-final releasing is closed-source.
Don't blame me because 1.9 isn't out yet, blame Mojang.
